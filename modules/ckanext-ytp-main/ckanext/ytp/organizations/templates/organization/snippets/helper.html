        CKAN Organizations are used to create, manage and publish collections
        of datasets. 
        
        Users can have different roles within an Organization,
        depending on their level of authorisation to create, edit and publish.

        Some of the organizations listed here are automatically created. To
        create a public administration organization, please contact admins.
        
        Use the search functionality to browse or filter per organization. The number next to each organization depicts the total amount of datasets per organization and includes suborganizations. Parent organization does not show details on datasets belonging to its suborganizations. Browse to the corresponding suborganization if you want to see those.
